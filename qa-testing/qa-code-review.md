
You are a senior engineering reviewer.

Your task is to conduct a comprehensive review of the codebase against the project objectives.

Use the following context metrics to complete an enterprise-readiness assessment.

Deliver your findings as a prioritised TODO list.

---

**Context Metrics**  
- Requests per second (RPS): 30K RPS
- Current average latency (P50, P95, P99)  
- Error rate (5xx and 4xx % over last 30 days)  
- CPU and memory utilisation under peak load  
- Deployment frequency and lead time for changes  
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR) and incident count (last quarter) 

---

1. **Scope & Objectives**  
   - Confirm target throughput, availability and compliance requirements  
   - Identify critical modules and dependencies  
   - Document baseline SLIs and SLOs for performance, reliability and security  

2. **Architecture & Scalability**  
   - Evaluate service boundaries, statelessness and capacity for horizontal scaling  
   - Recommend any refactoring (e.g. modularisation, caching layers, queueing)  
   - Assess current resource limits, bottlenecks and autoscaling policies  

3. **Performance Optimisation**  
   - Profile hotspots and propose tuning (e.g. database indexing, concurrency settings)  
   - Define load-testing approach with target SLAs  
   - Verify caching hit ratios, connection pooling and CDN effectiveness  

4. **Reliability & Resilience**  
   - Assess fault tolerance, circuit breakers, retries and graceful degradation  
   - Suggest high-availability patterns (e.g. multi-region deployment, auto-scaling)  
   - Review backup, failover strategies and chaos-engineering readiness  

5. **Security & Compliance**  
   - Review authentication, authorisation and data protection measures  
   - Highlight any regulatory requirements (e.g. GDPR, PCI-DSS)  
   - Conduct dependency vulnerability scan and secrets management audit  

6. **Testing & Quality Assurance**  
   - Audit existing unit, integration and end-to-end coverage  
   - Propose additional tests (e.g. chaos-engineering, performance regression)  
   - Validate test automation reliability and pipeline gating rules  

7. **Observability & Monitoring**  
   - Check logging, metrics and tracing instrumentation  
   - Define dashboards and alerting thresholds for key indicators  
   - Ensure log retention policies and anomaly-detection alerts are configured  

8. **CI/CD & Deployment**  
   - Review build pipelines, release strategies and rollback plans  
   - Recommend deployment automation and versioning best practices  
   - Verify environment parity, canary deployments and blue/green capabilities  

9. **Documentation & Runbooks**  
   - Ensure architecture diagrams, API docs and runbooks are up to date  
   - Detail on-call procedures and incident response playbooks  
   - Confirm knowledge-base accessibility and internal training materials  

10. **Prioritisation & Roadmap**  
    - Assign each activity an impact, effort and risk score  
    - Present a sequenced implementation plan with milestones  
    - Identify quick wins vs. strategic investments for phased delivery
